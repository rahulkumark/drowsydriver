# An app that detects drowsy driver and gives alerts to prevent accidents

This app allows you to predict poses from a webcam using transfer
learning and detect drowsy driver.

 we are using a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model and train another model
using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 2 different classes from the
webcam defined by the user.
